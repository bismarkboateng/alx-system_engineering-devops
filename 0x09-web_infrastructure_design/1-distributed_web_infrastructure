1. For every additional element, adding another server prevents SPOF.

2. The distribution algorithm is called Round Robin.
   This algorithm is the most commonly implemented. It works by using each server behind the load balancer in
   turns, according to their weights. It's also probably the smoothest and most fair algorithm as the servers'
   processing time stays equally distributed.

3. My HAproxy load balancer is using Active-Active which means all the servers are working simultaneously, just like
   Round-Robin, where 1st client go to the first server and the second goes to the second server making the servers
   to balance in service to avoid traffic.
   In Active-Active Load-Balancer, the server work simultaneously but in the Active-Passive one server works all the
   time but if a failout occur then the other server take control of the current working activities.

4. Master-slave replication enables data from one database server (the master) to be replicated to one or more other
   database servers (the slaves)
